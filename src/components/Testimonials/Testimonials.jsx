      We as a family of 6 had an effortless and cozy first time international trip to Malaysia organised by Frugal trail.<br /><br />
      
      The most important and appealing aspect is that Frugal trail listened to our plans and did not offer a generic package. From seamless flight bookings to perfectly situated accommodations at 'The Robertson', they handled every detail.<br /><br />
      
      We effortlessly explored Kuala Lumpur's dazzling Petronas Towers and the vibrant energy of Chinatown, all within our budget and comfort.<br /><br />
      
      Frugal Trail didn't just plan a trip, they gifted us with precious, stress-free family memories. They tailored the trip to our needs. For our first international adventure, it was nothing short of magical.<br /><br />
      
      Thank you Frugal trail and looking forward to take your assistance in many of our future adventures.</>,

More Than a Planner — A Complete Travel Partner.<br /><br />
The Best thing about Consulting Monish about your Travel Itinerary, Budget etc is that he takes you through a Breezy Process because he literally takes care of all your doubts and queries and tries to provide you a complete A - Z Transparent idea starting from Visa, Flight, Hotels, Sight Seeing etc.<br /><br />
But here's the best part. According to your budget and travel needs and mode like Solo, Couples or Family he makes you aware of every small detail with regards to the trip which others don't even explain.<br /><br />
He literally becomes your virtual guide in your travel because he guides you right from your airport terminals info, flight options, taxis or even public transport and even guide you to the ways to head there at the planning stage itself. One will never see such a thorough guidance along with costs and the day trip ideas and details that he gives and the transparency he shows is unprecedented.<br /><br />
I have to say that during my travel, he patiently answered all my queries before travel and some doubts while in the middle of the travel also which shows the good support system.<br /><br />
Also regarding local cuisines, cost and specific unexplored off beat locations details was so helpful for my travel.

Stress-Free, Budget-Friendly, and Unforgettable.<br /><br />
I recently had the pleasure of working with my dear buddy Monish to plan an unforgettable trip to Europe, and I couldn't be happier with the experience! Our adventure covered Germany, Paris, Austria, Switzerland, and Prague, and every moment was truly magical.<br /><br />
From the very beginning, Monish was incredibly attentive and supportive. He helped me with everything from preparing my Visa documents to creating a detailed itinerary tailored to our preferences, as well as booking flight tickets and rooms. His attention to detail and dedication were evident in every aspect of the trip.<br /><br />
Monish went above and beyond to suggest must-visit places, book all the attractions, and ensure everything was perfectly handled. What truly stood out was his availability and passion for travel. He was always updated with the latest changes and information, which proved to be incredibly helpful.<br /><br />
Even when it was late for him, he was just a call or message away to assist me with any queries or issues, making the journey completely stress-free.<br /><br />
Additionally, Monish managed to guide us and ensure a budget-friendly trip without compromising on the experience. His expertise and enthusiasm made all the difference, and I highly recommend Monish to anyone looking to plan a seamless and enjoyable travel experience.<br /><br />
Thank you, Monish, for making my trip so special and memorable!
